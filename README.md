# ODI Learning Workflow Orchestrator (OLWO)

OLWO connects HubSpot, Moodle, Google Calendar, and Forecast so ODI Learning teams can manage bookings, enrollments, and schedules.

- For a non‑technical user guide (workflows, how to use OLWO), see MANUAL.md.
- For installation, environment variables, and integrations, see INSTALLING.md.

## Learner verification link
Share this with learners to check their access:

`https://<your-host>/enrollments/verify?deal_id=HS_DEAL_ID&email=user@example.com`

They will see the courses in their booking, enrollment status, access dates, and expiry. Learners must be associated to the HubSpot deal with the label “Learner”.
